# Crossroads

The classic Roblox game, converted to a Rojo project automatically!

The only change I made to Crossroads for syncback to run was grouping all of the `SpawnLocation` Instances into a model named `SpawnLocations`.

This is a project that's mostly meant to test the syncback functionality of Rojo, but it's also a neat look at how [Crossroads](https://www.roblox.com/games/1818/Classic-Crossroads) is laid out.
